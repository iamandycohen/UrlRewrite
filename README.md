Url Rewrite
===========

While there are many Redirect / Rewrite modules available in the Sitecore Marketplace, I created this one to address the fact that most of them cannot create redirects that are Site specific.

In addition to adding Site specific redirect capabilities, I have modeled the data structure to closely match the functionality of Microsoft's IIS Url Rewrite plugin.

*** This module is not supported if you are using xDB Cloud Edition ***
Sitecore Support: "Creation of custom segments is not supported by the Experience Analytics in the xDB Cloud service. This should be fixed in a future service update." https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/966080
